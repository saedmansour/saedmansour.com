TIL: "HTTP status codes were established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1992,
as a part of the HTTP 0.9 spec. They were defined by Tim Berners-Lee, the same person
who single-handedly invented the web and the first web browser in 1990.
Berners-Lee based the HTTP status codes on FTP status codes, which were already well
established by 1990; the official FTP spec is dated 1985, although FTP has actually been
in use much longer."
